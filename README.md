<h>Birds Migration Data Analysis</h>
Initial project

<h>Data</h>
I had the next data for my project:
- CSV-file with birds of <i>Purple martin</i> species(their locations at different time)
- SHP-file with countries of the world and their locations
- SHP-file with protected areas in South America and their locations

<h>Task</h>
I as a bird conservation expert want to understand migration patterns of <i>Purple martins</i>. In my research, I discover that these birds typically spend the summer breeding season in the eastern United States, and then migrate to South America for the winter. But since this bird is under threat of endangerment, I'd like to take a closer look at the locations that these birds are more likely to visit.
There are several protected areas in South America, which operate under special regulations to ensure that species that migrate (or live) there have the best opportunity to thrive. I'd like to know if purple martins tend to visit these areas. To answer this question, I'll use some recently collected data that tracks the year-round location of eleven different birds.
